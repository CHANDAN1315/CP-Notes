# Observations that it is a sliding window problem
1. If they ask you to do something by taking fixed amount of array element e.g k =5
2. If the problem ask for subsequence with k element then sorting is also used with it
3. There are sliding window problem with variable window and it uses two pointer with some good implementation.
  eg : leetcode 1493
