```
- We can create a unique Binary Tree using Inorder with postorder and inorder with preorder
- If you have a perfect binary tree, then given only the PREORDER and POSTORDER, you can construct your unique binary tree
- If we have only one node in binary tree then we can construct unique binary tree from preorder and postorder traversal.
