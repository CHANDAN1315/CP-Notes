## Approch to solve DP problem 
- Find the constraints on which you can construct the recursion tree
- Construct the recursion tree 
- Find the base case
- Find the overlapping cases


## How to form the recurance relation for dp
- Try to represent the poblem in terms of index
- Do all possible staffs on that index according to the poblem statement
- count all ways -> sum of all the possible ways
- if the problem about find the minimum/maximum then ->  min/max(off all the stuffs)
